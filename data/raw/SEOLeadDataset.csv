"Hi folks~ I'm looking for a REMOTE job opening (if it's on-site, I stay in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia)
I have various skills:
- illustration (in children-book style and Japanese anime style). I have experienced writing and drawing for webtoon.
- comic writing/narrative writing
- graphic design
- copywriting
- photography (and videography to some extend)
- social media managing
- customer experience and client acquisitions
- some experience with SEO/SEM (or digital marketing strategy in general)
And a bachelor degree in Communication Science (Broadcasting), which gives me experience with TV show production and journalistic writing (I learnt basic photography/videography back then to report and investigate news material).
I would prefer a job in illustration/comic industry, but I'm also very open for other possibilities where my skill can be utilized.
I'd like to learn, so most of my skills are actually something I learnt during my past work experiences or something I explore in side jobs and hobbies👍 (I even have some experiences in event organizing)
I have high interests in pop culture, random trivias, sea animals, playing mobile games, watching AAA gameplay in youtube, Korean drama, manga, manhwa, danmei, music, the vocaloid song renditions by Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, cosplay, movies... I just love indulging myself in stories in various medias, aside from taking care of my cats and dog.
My digital portfolio for illustration is available at be.net/cynorca
My other portfolios (like my graphic design/photography works) or CV are also available if needed.
So if you guys stumble on a LEGIT opening (please no sweatshop or sus working conditions! 🥺🙏) that might suited my skillset, remember yours truly is available! Thanks for your help (*´∀`)♪
P.S: for webtoons, I'm good with adapting novel-to-webtoon, developing your stories (if you're overwhelmed on how to design your plot), sketching and lining work, and some simple coloring works. One of my project actually won 3rd place in Webtoon Contest Indonesia for comedy category, so at the very least, you can rest assured that I can make a readable comic!

Think the top search result is always the best one to click on? Think again. Fraudsters are using sophisticated Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques to push their fake websites to the top of your search results. When you search for a product or service, these imposter sites often appear above legitimate businesses.
Recent investigations have uncovered hundreds of fraudulent websites masquerading as legitimate Canadian businesses, complete with fake reviews and professional designs. For instance, Flight Centre recently discovered numerous fake phone numbers appearing in Google search results for their locations across Canada, leading to scammers who stole thousands from unsuspecting customers looking to book travel.",NotLead

"I used AI to buy a $1,500 camera — and I never stepped into a store, called a rep, or asked anyone for help.
Here’s how that process went — and why every business needs to start optimizing for AI Search right now.
I recently decided to upgrade my camera setup to support better vlogging and photography content.
I’m not a photographer and didn’t know which Fujifilm model was best for me. Instead of heading to a store or contacting a rep, I turned to ChatGPT.
I gave it this prompt:
👉 “I’m looking to purchase a Fujifilm camera for vlogging and photography. I love the film simulations. I’m comparing the X100VI, T50, T30II, and S20. Ask me questions to help narrow down the best fit.”
That one prompt triggered a full discovery session — more detailed than most sales reps provide.
ChatGPT asked me:
- What type of content I create (video vs photo)?
- Do I travel often and need something compact?
- Is in-body stabilization important?
- What's my budget?
- Do I prefer interchangeable lenses or fixed?
After I answered, it analyzed all the models and ranked them based on my needs. It explained the tradeoffs clearly — in a way that gave me full confidence in the decision.
We narrowed it down to the Fujifilm T50, then I asked:
✅ “Which lens should I start with?”
✅ “What are the best YouTube reviews to watch?”
✅ “Which stores are best to buy from?”
✅ “What’s the warranty comparison?”
✅ “Who has the best price right now?”
It answered all of that — and then gave me direct product links, discount codes, and a ranked list of retailers based on price, availability, and warranty policies.
Here’s the punchline:
⚠️ No store rep ever spoke to me
⚠️ No one had to convince me
⚠️ The business that got the sale? They never even knew I was a lead
AI handled the entire sales process.
If your business isn’t optimized for AI Search, you are being skipped.
You need:
- A fast, mobile-friendly website
- E-commerce functionality
- Strong SEO 
- Detailed product content
- Trust signals like reviews and warranty info
AI has become the customer’s best sales consultant — and most businesses aren't even trying to show up.
Want to stay in the game? Optimize for the new buyer journey. The one that starts — and ends — with AI.

"And this is why I love being a small business and working with other small businesses..
Unless you've ever turned an idea in to a side line income and then a full time business it's hard to understand just how badly we tend to it, excel sheets here, notes there, none of which talk to each other. And this is completely normal! A foundation of absolute chaos.
But that's exactly why small businesses like mine are needed, we're small enough to be able to cater to your chaos, to adapt the way I do things to suit the unique way that you do yours!

"What is a Keyword in SEO, and Why is it Important?
SEO helps your website rank higher in search engine results, leading to more free (organic) traffic without paying for ads.
**Keyword in SEO:**
A keyword in SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is a specific word or phrase that users enter into search engines when they are looking for information, products, or services online. Keywords are the foundation of SEO because they directly connect the content on your website with what users are searching for.
**Importance of Keywords:**
1. **Search Engine Ranking:** Keywords help search engines understand the content of your web pages. By strategically using relevant keywords, you can improve your website's visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs), making it easier for potential customers to find you.
2. **Targeted Traffic:** Using the right keywords allows you to attract visitors who are specifically interested in what you offer. This leads to higher-quality traffic, which is more likely to convert into leads, sales, or other desired actions.
3. **Content Relevance:** Keywords ensure that your content aligns with the search intent of your audience. By incorporating keywords that match what your audience is searching for, your content becomes more relevant and useful to them.
4. **Competitive Advantage:** Understanding and using the right keywords can give you a competitive edge. By targeting keywords that your competitors may have overlooked, you can capture a portion of the market that might otherwise be missed.
In summary, keywords are essential in SEO as they help search engines match your content with users' queries, drive targeted traffic, and ultimately support your online marketing goals.
Keywords help attract visitors who are actively searching for content, products, or services like yours, increasing the likelihood of conversions.
